Application for verifying Digital Health Certificates working on Windows.
Purpose of this application is to create such application for Windows devices equipped with cameras to scan above documents.
All application I have seen are for Android/IOS.
No data being stored anywhere, internet connection is just for downloading public keys to verify issuer of DHC.
